## Princeton Algorithms course on Coursera - Python
This repository contains Python implementations for the Algorithms course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome).
It is a work in progress, and it contains practice files, solutions to the end-of-week problems. Some files will work, some not yet, and some might never. The main purpose of the repository is to have a record of my progress and keep track of my work on this course.
